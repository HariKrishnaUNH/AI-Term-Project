# AI-Term-Project
This repository contains code for developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict heart failure using Python and Keras. The model is built and trained using the provided code.
# Code Overview
The code provided in this repository includes the following key components:
•	Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset "heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv" is loaded and preprocessed to prepare it for model training.
•	Model Building: An ANN model is defined and built using Keras, with appropriate layers and configurations for binary classification.
•	Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training data and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score.
# Code Usage
To use the code for heart failure prediction, follow these steps:
1.	Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to prepare the features and target variable for model training.
2.	Model Building: The ANN model is defined and built using Keras, with appropriate layers and configurations for binary classification.
3.	Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training data and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score.
